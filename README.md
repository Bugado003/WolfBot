# WolfBot
Bot for Discord Server Lunarium Wolfs

this bot is meant to make ur server funny and active, pls suggest stuff, this is an open-source bot in the end:)

dont forget to report bugs here on github

**Requirements**
- x64 processor from 2018 or newer (due to instructions, etc., this code may not work on older processors, it's not my problem if you try to change the code ignoring this requirement)
-Visual studio
-DSharp plus 4.4.6
-.Net 8.0.2
-Windows Operating System

# ANYTHING PROPERTARY (LIKE TOKENS) SHOULD BE IN THE "CONFIG.JSON" FILE
after compiling the code u should move the config.json file with your data to the same folder the .exe is in

also, this bot is not meant to be used with databases, it is made to people who cant afford a server to run the bot and work with databases
(Bot still in early development okay?)
Enjoy :D
